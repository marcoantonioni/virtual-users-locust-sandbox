Unit testing stateful processes that make use of storage persistence can be challenging due to several main complexities:

1. Non-deterministic behavior: When a process has a state that is persisted to storage, its behavior can become non-deterministic. For example, if a test modifies the state of the process, it can affect the behavior of subsequent tests. This can make it difficult to isolate and reproduce test failures.

2. Dependencies: Stateful processes that use storage persistence often have dependencies on external resources, such as a database or file system. These dependencies can introduce additional complexity into unit testing, as they may need to be mocked or otherwise simulated in order to create a controlled testing environment.

3. Data integrity: Storage persistence can introduce issues related to data integrity, such as concurrent access to shared resources or race conditions. Testing these scenarios can be difficult, as they require careful setup and coordination.

4. Test data management: Managing test data for stateful processes can be challenging, especially if the data needs to be persisted across multiple tests. Tests may need to clean up after themselves to avoid interfering with subsequent tests, or they may need to rely on external tools to manage test data.

5. Performance: When dealing with storage persistence, unit tests can be slower and more resource-intensive than tests that operate entirely in memory. This can lead to longer test run times and increased complexity in managing test suites.

To address these complexities, it's important to design tests that are robust, well-organized, and repeatable. This may involve using mocking frameworks to simulate external dependencies, carefully managing test data, and using tools like test fixtures to ensure a consistent testing environment. Additionally, it may be necessary to invest in automated testing infrastructure that can manage the complexities of stateful, persistent processes.
